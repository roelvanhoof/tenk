# About

TenK is an expo app for iOS and Android that helps you keep track of the time you spend on reaching your goals.

I created this app because I wanted to keep track of my goals and after searching and trying a lot of apps
in the App Store I found that none of them did what I wanted them to do. Some did way too much, others did not
do what they were supposed to, some of them were annoying to use, etc. etc.

This app is really simple: You add a goal, start a timer or stopwatch, the app tells you when you will reach your goal.
